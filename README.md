# -Heuristic-algorithm-for-ring-cutting-stock-problem-
A problem of two-dimensional optimization of the cutting of rings on a rectangular plate is considered. The rectangle has a predetermined dimension of only one side, the second dimension should be determined by arranging all given rings and at the same time minimizing its value. The rings may have different diameters.
